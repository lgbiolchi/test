LEARNING GITHUB
- it allows us to share our work with colleagues, team members or other people based on git repositories
- git is the technology and github is the platform to share and collaborate

THE STEPS TO COMMIT A FILE TO GITHUB ARE
- first we have to create a git repository
- add the repository to github "git remote add origin 'link for the remote provided by github'"
- check if we have a remote "git remote -v"
- push our code or whatever it is to github "git push -u origin master" --- where origin is the name we used two steps ago and master is the branch we are pushing
